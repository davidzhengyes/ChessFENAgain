# ChessFENAgain
Improvements to ChessFEN. Speed optimizations incoming and less breakable code.

<br>
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======
Highlight move MUST be unchecked!

<br>
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
Undetectable for sure. Offline compatible as well (stronger if using stockfish GET api)

<br>
Still very unusable for anyone who isn't Me. Documentation coming soon.


**Possible Improvements (no particular order)** 
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

=======
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
<br> Automove (No click needed!)
<br> Lesser eval (Doesn't show the very best move)
<br> Better looking GUI, and more intuitive, so doesn't crash on a misinput
<br> Efficiency (Searching within the board and not the whole screen)
<br> Testing algorithm edge cases (User inaccuracy) and also can write a testing algorithm against games already played
<br> Modify algorithm so it can be used on chessboards with the rank and file indicator on the other side (capture smaller part of each piece)
<br> Wrap all into .exe, easier to run by everyone.
<br> Make options to specify castling availability, en passant, half-move clock and fullmove number (not necessary)

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======

<br> stockfish version 16, taken from stockfish github june 30, 2023 release.
